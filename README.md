# An Examination of the Robustness of Reference-Free Image Captioning Evaluation Metrics
This repository contains code for the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14998) `An Examination of the Robustness of Reference-Free Image Captioning Evaluation Metrics'.

## Overview
Recently, reference-free metrics such as CLIPScore (Hessel et al., 2021) and UMIC (Lee et al., 2021) have been proposed for automatic evaluation of image captions, demonstrating a high correlation with human judgment. We provide insights into the strengths and limitations of reference-free metrics for image captioning evaluation, guiding future improvements in this area.
